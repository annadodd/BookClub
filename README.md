# BookClub

This Android app is in the beginning stages of implementation. 

The app will include an initial login screen, where the user can log in through a Facebook account. After logging in, they will reach the home screen where they may choose to receive book suggestions based on what their friends are reading. The user may also choose to start a book club and invite friends to share their thoughts on the selected book. 

Data will be collecting using the Facebook API. 

User information will be stored using Googleâ€™s Firebase server.
